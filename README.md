# Tasky

## Description

This project is a simple to-do-list application with a backend. Not only does it have a server and a database hooked up, it allows you to track to-do-list items with a nice GUI.

## Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or another package manager
[Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) or another Database creator

## Installation

First, you will need to git clone into a folder onto your computer. Afterwards, you can simply open the folder within a text editor of your choice and run the 'npm install' command. This command will install of the prerequisites you need to get the server up and running. Now, you may open up the database.sql file and copy/paste it into Postico. This will generate the database and tables you need. Finally, you can run the npm start command in your terminal and navigate to the browser at localhost:5000/ to see the application up and running.

## Usage

Usage is fairly simple. A user may input a task and then push the enter key or click the submit button. The task will auto-generate on the page, as well as the list of previous to-do tasks. These tasks will be stored within the database and will not be deleted unless the user chooses to delete them by using either the delete button or the delete all button.
